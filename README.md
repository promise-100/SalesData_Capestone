### Project Title: Sales Analysis

### Project Overview:
In this project, i will dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. The project aims to analyse the sales performance of a business, uncover key insights such as product performance, regional performance and sales trend.
This project showcases my ability to manipulate and derieve insight from large dataset, enabling me to make data driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

### Data Sources:
Considering this is a capestone project, my trainer, The Incubator Hub provided the sales dataset for this analysis.

### Data Structure:
The original dataset is an excel file with 50,000 rows and 7 columns which includes: OrderID, CustomerID, Product, Region, OrderDate, Quantity and Unit Price.

### Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https:www.microsoft.com)
   1. For Data Cleaning and Analysis.
   2. For Data Analysis.
- SQL - Structured Query Language
   1. For Querying of Data.
- Microsoft Powerbi [Download Here](https:www.microsoft.com)
   1. For Data Analysis
   2. For Data Visualization.
- GitHub
   1. For Portfolio Building.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
The dataset went through some processes of data cleaning and preparations to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involves;
- Data Inspection.
- Removing Duplicates.
- Addressing missing values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data suc as;
- Retrieve the total sales for each product category.
- Find the number of sales transactions in each region.
- Find the highest-selling product by total sales value
- Calculate total revenue per product.
- Calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
- Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
- Identify products with no sales in the last quarter.

### Data Analysis:
This is where I include some Excel Formulars, SQL Queries and DAX Functions used during the analysis.
- Excel Formulars used:
I used Excel Formulars to calculate the following;
 1. Total Sales = SUM(SalesData!H:H)
 2. Total Sales by each Region = SUMIF(D:D,D2,H:H)
 3. Average Sales for each product using AverageIF = AVERAGEIF(C:C,C2,H:H)
